            <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
            <p>
                I am a Front-end Web Developer who is very skilled in semantic HTML and CSS, whilst just starting in JavaScript. I do not have a lot of experience, but volunteering in hackathons and tech-related events has given me a lot of confidence, working in teams and with other people generally. I spend most of my time coding solutions to Frontend Mentor challenges and trying to implement designs from other sources.

            <h3>WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>

            <div class="section-block-segment-container">
                <h4>DSC UNILAG</h4>
                <h5>Full-time</h5>
                <p>
                    I volunteered in the Open Hack Week event organized by the Developer Students Club, Unilag to contribute to the greater good by building sites for NGOs.
                    <br>
                    I doubled as Team Lead and Frontend Developer, for which I and my team were able to successfully deliver a site for a farm Inititative.

                <h5>Full-time</h5>
                <p>
                    I volunteered to be part of a team that built a website for the University of Lagos Engineering Society (ULES).
                    <br>
                    My team was able to successfully implement and deliver outstanding designs that composed the site.

            <h3>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h3>
            <h4>ULES WEBSITE</h4>

            <p>
                Few months later, I single-handedly rebuilt the ULES website. This was in a bid to practice my SASS skills.
                <br>
                The site is built in HTML, CSS(SCSS), and minimal JavaScript, from scratch.
